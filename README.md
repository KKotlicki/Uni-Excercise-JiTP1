This repository contains my exercises for university course of JiTP (Coding Languages and Techniques).
Every project is written in C++ standard 11 and uses Code::Blocks IDE.
Each exercise was completed in one week.
The main test files were usually not graded.
zad_m# are small assignments (for 2 points)
zad_c# are big assignments (for 5 points)

The course was conducted in Polish language, so assignment descriptions in pdfs and some variable names in code have Polish names.

(3rd exercise was done on school computer and I lost the files for it, so it is omitted in the repository)
