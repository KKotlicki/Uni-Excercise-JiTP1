# JiTP
This repository contains my exercises for university course of JiTP (Coding Languages and Techniques).

## Repository info

Every project is written in C++ standard 11 and uses Code::Blocks IDE.

- zad_m# are small assignments (for 2 points)
- zad_c# are big assignments (for 5 points)

The course was conducted in Polish language, so assignment descriptions in pdfs and some variable names in code have Polish names.

## Course info

Each exercise was completed in one week.

The main test files were usually not graded.



(3rd exercise was done on school computer, so the files were lost and it is omitted in the repository)
